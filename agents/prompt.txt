This folder "C:\Users\Lucas\OneDrive\Documentos\Projetos\Sandbox\ai-agents\.sandbox\folder" is a mess! Folders should be named as "images", "sheets" and "pdfs" and files should be named as "file_##.{ext}" where ## is a number from 01 to 99 in each folder. Apply recursively to all subfolders.

When all files are correctly arranged. For each created folder, create a image with the following text: "Folder: {folder_name} contains {number_of_files} files" and save it as "folder.jpg" in the folder.

- Pdf folder image should also have a frog holding the PDF icon.
- Excel folder image should also have a cat holding the Excel icon.
- Image folder image should also have a dog holding the Image icon.

The final structure should be:

folder
├── images
|   ├── folder.jpg
│   ├── file_01.png
│   └── ...
├── pdfs
|   ├── folder.jpg
│   ├── file_01.pdf
│   └── ...
└── sheets
    ├── folder.jpg
    ├── file_01.xlsx
    └── ...
