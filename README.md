# ai-agents

## Overview

This repository serves as my personal sandbox for experimenting with AI agent architectures and implementations. Here I explore various approaches to building autonomous intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act in different environments.

## Project Goals

- Explore different AI agent architectures (reactive, deliberative, hybrid)
- Implement agents using various frameworks and technologies
- Experiment with multi-agent systems and communication
- Test learning-based agents using reinforcement learning
- Document findings and best practices for future reference

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agents.git
cd ai-agents

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
